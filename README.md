# Naive Baayes Classifier  
This is a Python implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier that has two important features:  
  
1. continuous features can be merged with multinomial features; and  
2. missing data in both the output class and input features will be handled without error.  
  
Please see the file `Example_Naive_Bayes.ipynb` for a walkthrough.  
  
Continuous variables are modeled with a conditional linear Gaussian, while multinomial variables are modeled with a tabular conditional probability distribution.  
  
## Please Contribute  
If you find an error, better way to compute the parameters of the algorithm, or have a new feature to add please submit a pull request.
